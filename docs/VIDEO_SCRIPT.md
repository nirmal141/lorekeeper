## THE SCRIPT

### [0:00–0:08] THE HOOK
*Show: Intro screen with "Lorekeeper" title typing out*

**Voiceover:**
> "In every game you've ever played, the world freezes when you leave. NPCs forget you exist. We built something different."

---

### [0:08–0:15] CHOOSE A WORLD
*Action: Click "Choose Your World" → show the 5 scenario cards with images*

**Voiceover:**
> "Lorekeeper — five persistent worlds across five genres. Each with its own NPCs, memories, and timeline. Let's enter the fantasy world."

*Action: Click "The Ashwood Post"*

---

### [0:15–0:30] FIRST CONVERSATION
*Action: Click on Aldric. Show the 3 starter choices appearing.*

**Voiceover:**
> "We meet Aldric, a merchant. Notice the starter choices — the game guides you in."

*Action: Click "I'm heading into the Ashwood. Any advice?"*
*Wait for response with choices appearing*

**Voiceover:**
> "Aldric responds in character. Gemini generates his dialogue based on his personality, goals, and mood. And now he gives us three ways to continue."

---

### [0:30–0:45] MEMORY IN ACTION
*Action: Click a choice or type: "I'm actually heading north to hunt the dragon. Can you help me?"*
*Wait for response — point out the "memories recalled" accordion*

**Voiceover:**
> "See this — 'memories recalled.' LlamaIndex just retrieved our earlier conversation using semantic search and fed it to Gemini. Aldric remembers we asked about the Ashwood. He's building context."

*Action: Click the accordion briefly to show the retrieved memories*

---

### [0:45–1:05] THE WORLD MOVES ON
*Action: Click ← Back, then click "Fast Forward"*

**Voiceover:**
> "Now we leave. And here's where it gets interesting."

*Show: "Previously on Lorekeeper..." recap phase typing out*

**Voiceover:**
> "A Temporal durable workflow fires. Gemini simulates what happens next."

*Show: "While you were away..." event phase — bandits raid or similar*

**Voiceover:**
> "The world moved on without us. Bandits attacked."

*Show: "Meanwhile, whispers spread..." gossip phase*

**Voiceover:**
> "And NPCs talked to each other. Aldric told Mira about the dragon hunter. That's us."

*Action: Click "Return to World"*

---

### [1:05–1:20] THE PAYOFF
*Action: Click on Blacksmith Mira. Type: "Have you heard about anyone hunting dragons?"*

**Voiceover:**
> "Now watch this. We never told Mira about the dragon."

*Wait for response — Mira references the dragon*

**Voiceover:**
> "She knows. Aldric gossiped. That gossip was stored in her memory through LlamaIndex, and Gemini wove it naturally into her response. Three AI systems coordinating in real time."

---

### [1:20–1:30] THE CLOSE
*Show: The Architecture panel in sidebar — Gemini, LlamaIndex, Temporal*

**Voiceover:**
> "Gemini for generation. LlamaIndex for semantic memory. Temporal for durable world simulation. Five genres. Persistent NPCs. A world that never stops. This is Lorekeeper."

## KEY LINES TO NAIL

If you forget everything else, land these three:

1. **"The world moved on without us."** — during the event reveal
2. **"We never told Mira about the dragon."** — before the gossip payoff
3. **"Three AI systems coordinating in real time."** — after the payoff

These three lines tell the entire story.
